# Genetic Algorithm on 2D Rastrigin Function

The goal of this repository is to explore the basics of neuroevolution and genetic algorithms (GA). Specifically, it implements a GA to find the global minimum of the 2D Rastrigin function and visualizes the optimization process. The inspiration for this repository comes from Chapter **2.2.2, page 24** of the book [*"Neuroevolution: Harnessing Creativity in AI Agent Design"*](https://neuroevolutionbook.com/), an MIT Press Book by Sebastian Risi, Yujin Tang, David Ha, and Risto Miikkulainen, where an image of a GA process applied to the 2D Rastrigin function is shown.
